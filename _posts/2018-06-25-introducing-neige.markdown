Hey there, **welcome on Neige**! I'm Quentin, the developer behind Neige. Let me quickly introduce you to this brand new Jekyll theme.

## Minimalist touch

As you see, Neige has a very minimalist design. The aspect is kept clean and pure because I built it with simplicity in mind. By creating something like this, I make sure every part is polished and well-finished for the best experience.

You can take a look at how every element looks with the Neige theme by reading the [style guide post](/2018/06/21/style-guide).

By the way, the name "Neige" comes from French which means "Snow" and clearly identifies to something pure and clean.

## Easy setup

Neige is a blogging Jekyll theme. It offers the basic blogging features with a minimal configuration to allow anyone to quickly setup a blog.

You basically just have to follow the installation instructions and to fill the website with your content. Then just write your blog posts as you would do on any other blogging platform!
