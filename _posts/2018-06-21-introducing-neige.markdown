Hey there, **welcome on Neige**! I'm Quentin, the developer behind Neige. Let me quickly introduce you to this brand new Jekyll theme.

## Minimalist touch

As you see, Neige has a very minimalist design. The aspect is kept clean and pure because I built it with simplicity in mind. By creating something like this, I make sure every part is polished and pretty. By the way, "Neige" means "Snow" in French. Pure and clean.

## Easy setup

Neige is a blogging Jekyll theme. It offers the basic blogging features with a minimal configuration to allow anyone to quickly setup a blog.
