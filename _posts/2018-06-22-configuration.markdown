The whole configuration part is happening in one file: \`_config.yml\`. Inside this file, you can add and configure informations about your website.

Every part of the website is configurable here like:

\* Basic information about the website (title, description, language...) 

\* Top navigation

\* Footer content

\* Pagination settings

\* And much more

The list of keys to configure are in the \[GitHub README file\](https://github.com/bellangerq/neige-theme) so check it out. There is also a \[configuration example file\](https://github.com/bellangerq/neige-theme/blob/master/_config.yml)  so you can see how it look.
